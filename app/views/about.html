			<h3>Education</h3>
			<p>I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona State University with a bachelors degree in Business with an emphasis in Computer Information Systems. I've been doing graphic/web design for 4-5 years. Although I majored in business, I can truly say that my passion is in web/graphic design.</p>
